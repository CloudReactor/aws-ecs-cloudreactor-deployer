# Override this file with steps to perform before the Docker image is built.
# If your code needs to be compiled, you can add steps here to compile it,
# for example:
# name: Package code using maven
# command: "mvn package"
# args:
#   chdir: "./src"
# tags:
#  - build
#
# After it is compiled, your Dockerfile should COPY the binary (JAR file in
# the case of JDK projects).
